ImmPort team members, [@ImmPortDB](https://twitter.com/immportdb?lang=en), and collaborators were thrilled to host a series of talks and a hands-on workshop during the 2019 [Federation of Clinical Immunology Societies ](http://www.focisnet.org/meetings/focis-2019/)(FOCIS) Annual Meeting. The action packed session was chaired by ImmPort Scientific Program Director, [Sanchita Bhattacharya](http://buttelab.ucsf.edu/people/#sanchita-bio), [@SanchitaB](https://twitter.com/Sanchitab), PhD and Bioinformatics Project Lead of the Bakar Institute of Computational Health Sciences, UCSF, and included several enlightening presentations from ImmPort collaborators and team members:

**Precision Immunology: How High Parameter Technology Can Shape Immunotherapy**; Pratip K. Chattopadhyay, <https://bit.ly/2ZMfDP5>, Associate Professor, Langone Medical Center, NYU

**Enabling Precision Medicine in Neonatology: Leveraging Clinical and Omics Data to Study Preterm Birth**; Marina Sirota, [@msirota84](https://twitter.com/msirota84?lang=en), <https://bit.ly/2KeyU4r>, Assistant Professor, Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, UCSF

**Extracting Knowledge from Two Million Experiments Stored in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB)**; Bjoern Peters, <https://bit.ly/2KyYnZU>, Professor, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology

Sanchita also gave a talk on the [10,000 Immunomes Project](http://10kimmunomes.ucsf.edu/), which provided a great segue into a hands-on workshop utilizing live ImmPort [data](https://www.immport.org/shared/home). The workshop, organized by Zicheng Hu, Patrick Dunn, Henry Schaefer, Elizabeth Thomson, and Sanchita, provided an overview of ImmPort data, and insights into [ImmPort Galaxy](https://www.immportgalaxy.org/user/login?use_panels=True&redirect=%2F) (a suite of free tools for flow cytometry data analysis)!

Stay tuned, in future posts we’ll dig into the individual talks and provide insight into the folks advancing their respective fields through big data.
