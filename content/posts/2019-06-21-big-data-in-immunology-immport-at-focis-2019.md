ImmPort team members, [@ImmPortDB](https://twitter.com/immportdb?lang=en), and collaborators were thrilled to host a series of talks and a hands-on workshop during the 2019 [Federation of Clinical Immunology Societies ](http://www.focisnet.org/meetings/focis-2019/)(FOCIS) Annual Meeting. The action packed session was chaired by ImmPort Scientific Program Director, [Sanchita Bhattacharya](http://buttelab.ucsf.edu/people/#sanchita-bio), [@SanchitaB](https://twitter.com/Sanchitab), PhD and Bioinformatics Project Lead of the Bakar Institute of Computational Health Sciences, UCSF, and included several enlightening presentations from ImmPort collaborators and team members:

**Precision Immunology: How High Parameter Technology Can Shape Immunotherapy**; Pratip K. Chattopadhyay, <https://bit.ly/2ZMfDP5>, Associate Professor, Langone Medical Center, NYU

**Enabling Precision Medicine in Neonatology: Leveraging Clinical and Omics Data to Study Preterm Birth**; Marina Sirota, [@msirota84](https://twitter.com/msirota84?lang=en), <https://bit.ly/2KeyU4r>, Assistant Professor, Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, UCSF

**Extracting Knowledge from Two Million Experiments Stored in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB)**; Bjoern Peters, <https://bit.ly/2KyYnZU>, Professor, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology

Sanchita also gave a talk on the [10,000 Immunomes Project](http://10kimmunomes.ucsf.edu/), which provided a great segue into a hands-on workshop utilizing live ImmPort [data](https://www.immport.org/shared/home). The workshop, organized by Zicheng Hu, Patrick Dunn, Henry Schaefer, Elizabeth Thomson, and Sanchita, provided an overview of ImmPort data, and insights into [ImmPort Galaxy](https://www.immportgalaxy.org/user/login?use_panels=True&redirect=%2F) (a suite of free tools for flow cytometry data analysis)!

Stay tuned, in future posts weâ€™ll dig into the individual talks and provide insight into the folks advancing their respective fields through big data.
